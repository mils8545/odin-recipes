    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand 
            until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 2 cups bread flour, olive oil, salt,
            white sugar and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat 
            well until a stiff dough has formed. Cover and rise until doubled 
            in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 
            degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a 
            round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Cover with your 
            favorite sauce and toppings and bake in preheated oven until 
            golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
