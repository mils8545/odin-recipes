    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Cure</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons mustard powder</li>
        <li>4 whole chicken wings, drumettes and flats attached</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Batter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cups cornstarch</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups cold water, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 quart canola oil, plus more as needed, depending on size of pot</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cure chicken: In a bowl, add onion powder, salt, and mustard powder,
            and combine until well blended. Add the chicken wings to a large bowl,
            sprinkle with about half the curing mixture, and get in there with
            your hands to coat each piece well. (Note: This is enough cure for 8
            whole wings or 1 whole chicken, so you won’t need to use all of it.
            Save it in an airtight container for next time!) Place the coated
            wings in a single layer on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper,
            keeping the skin intact; lightly cover with parchment paper or plastic
            wrap. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring the cured chicken to room temperature. (You don’t want to fry
            ice-cold chicken, because it won’t cook all the way through, and it 
            will chill the frying oil.) Meanwhile, make the batter: In a large 
            bowl, add the cornstarch, flour, and salt. Slowly pour in the cold 
            water, whisking continuously, until the mixture is smooth and the 
            consistency of thin pancake batter. Add more water as needed to thin 
            the batter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil: Clip a candy or deep fry thermometer onto a large, heavy pot. 
            Add enough canola oil to fully submerge the wings—about halfway up the 
            side of the pot. (Oil expands as it heats, so don’t overfill the pot.) 
            Heat the oil over low heat until it reaches at least 300 degrees F. 
            (It’s fine if the oil temperature goes up as high as 350 degrees F, 
            because it will drop once the chicken is added.) Coat chicken: 
            Separate each wing into two pieces by slicing through the joint between 
            the drumette and the wing. When the oil is hot, add all the chicken 
            into the batter and fully coat each piece.</li>
        <li>First fry: Use tongs to pick up a wing and allow some of the excess 
            batter to drip off. Gently swirl the tip of the wing in the hot oil 
            to set the crust; this will prevent the chicken from sticking to the 
            bottom of the pot. Then ease the rest of the wing into the oil. Repeat 
            with all the wings. Fry for 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider 
            strainer to make sure the wings don’t stick together or to the bottom 
            of the pot. If they do stick, gently separate them with the spoon; try 
            not to tear the delicate crust!</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, use the slotted spoon to transfer the wings to drain 
            on a wire rack or paper towels on a baking sheet. The chicken will not 
            be fully cooked—there’s a second fry. Let the chicken rest, 15–20 
            minutes. Meanwhile, reheat the oil to just above 350 degrees F 
            (temperature will drop slightly when the chicken is added). Use the 
            slotted spoon to remove and discard stray bits of batter from the oil. 
            (Note: The chicken can be made to this point up to 1 day ahead and 
            refrigerated; bring it back to room temperature before the second fry.)</li>
        <li>Second fry: When the oil is hot, use the slotted spoon to gently ease 
            the wings back in. Fry for 4 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Use the slotted spoon to transfer the chicken pieces to a clean wire 
            rack set over a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Let cool for 5-10 minutes, 
            then serve. (Note: Frying oil can be reused several times for frying chicken. 
            Cool the oil completely, then pour through a fine-mesh strainer into a 
            clean jar. Cover and store in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.)</li>
